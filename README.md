# Graduate-Admission-Prediction-Deep-Learning

Prediction of Admission for a graduate using ANN

This dataset was built with the purpose of helping students in shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted output gives them a fair idea about their chances for a particular university.

Context This dataset is created for the prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective. Content The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.

The parameters included are :

* GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
* TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
* University Rating ( out of 5 )
* Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
* Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
* Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
* Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )
